/**
 * The document, assembled per request.
 *
 * ## Why this is a string and not an `index.html`
 *
 * A module that holds nothing ships a static `index.html` and lets Vite serve
 * it. This one cannot, for one reason: the ticket. It is minted once per
 * process and has to reach the page WITHOUT being fetchable on a door of its
 * own — a `GET /api/ticket` would be a route that hands the write credential to
 * anything that asks, which is the ticket abolished with extra steps. So the
 * document is generated, the ticket goes into it, and `vite.config.ts` runs the
 * result through `transformIndexHtml` so that Vite's own client and module
 * graph are injected exactly as they would be for a file on disk.
 *
 * ## Nothing is drawn here
 *
 * There is a root element and one inert JSON island. Every note, every anchor
 * verdict and every heading is built by React from what this program's own
 * store answers — and from the context the host sends, which this file cannot
 * see at all.
 *
 * ## The ticket rides in a JSON island
 *
 * `type="application/json"` rather than a generated JavaScript literal, because
 * a JSON island is inert: the browser neither parses nor executes it, and the
 * page reads it with `JSON.parse` off `textContent`. A value written into
 * executable source is the one place `textContent` cannot help.
 *
 * ## The one script, and why its type matters
 *
 * `<script type="module">`, which is what Vite serves and what a browser needs
 * in order to `import`. It is also the exact thing an opaque origin cannot
 * fetch without a permissive CORS header — see the essay on `server.cors` in
 * `vite.config.ts`. If this page ever loads in a frame and does nothing at all,
 * that header, or the `storage: true` that makes it unnecessary, is the first
 * thing to check, and the browser console is the only place it is visible.
